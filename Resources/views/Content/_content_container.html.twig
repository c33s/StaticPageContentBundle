{#
Twig Content Container
Extends a given base template or doesn't extend at all if an empty string is
provided. Includes the given contentlocation inside a block named "content".

The block name is hardcoded because twig has not included dynamic block names

TODO: variable content block name.
possible to inject variable for the content block?
requires dynamic blocks

other solution would be pre-generated container templates

TODO: performace check twig with or without "if"
maye create two different templates for sandboxed and not sandboxed.

TODO: only extend base template if base template string is not empty
currently not possible, because also if the "extends" tag is inside an if
statement, it gets evaluated (php class stuff)
#}

{# extending the base template #}
{% extends baseTemplate %}

{# hardcoded block name "content" #}
{% block content %}
    {# only sandbox if required #}
    {#% if isSandboxed is sameas(true) %}{% sandbox %}{% endif %#}
        {% include contentLocation %}
    {#% if isSandboxed is sameas(true) %}{% endsandbox %}{% endif %#}
{% endblock %}
